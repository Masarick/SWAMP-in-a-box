Configure Outgoing Email for SWAMP-in-a-Box
-------------------------------------------

Prerequisite: You will need an SMTP server that you are authorized to
relay mail through.

Step 1: Modify "/etc/postfix/main.cf" to use your SMTP server.

    - Set the relayhost attribute to your SMTP server.
    - Restart the 'postfix' service.

Step 2: Modify "/var/www/swamp-web-server/.env" to enable outgoing SWAMP
email.

    - Set MAIL_ENABLED to "true".
    - Set MAIL_DRIVER to "sendmail".
    - Set the MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS and MAIL_FROM_NAME to the email address
      and name you want to use as the sender of outgoing SWAMP emails.

    Notes:

    - The 'sendmail' driver uses the system's postfix mail system to do
      the actual delivery of the email message. If there are issues
      sending, the 'sendmail' driver via postfix will attempt to retry
      delivering of the message in the background without causing the UI
      to wait. Whereas using the 'smtp' driver bypasses postfix and makes
      connections directly to your SMTP server. Int this case the UI will
      wait for an acknowledgment that the message was sent.
    - Editing "/var/www/swamp-web-server/.env" requires root access.

Step 3: Modify /opt/swamp/etc/swamp.conf to configure outgoing email for
notifications that assessments are completed.

    - Set email.host to your SMTP server.
    - Set email.arun.subject to the subject line to be used for
      assessment completion notification emails.
    - Set email.from to the name and email address you want to use as
      the sender of assessment completion notification emails.
    - Restart the swamp service so your changes to swamp.conf are in
      effect.

            Use the following command:
            service swamp restart

    Note:

    - Editing "/opt/swamp/etc/swamp.conf" requires root access.


Enable "Contact Us" for SWAMP-in-a-Box
-----------------------------------------

Prerequisite: You must have configured outgoing email for SWAMP-in-a-Box
in order to allow users to submit "Contact Us" messages via a web form.

Step 1: Modify "/var/www/swamp-web-server/.env" to configure contact
message recipients.

    - Set MAIL_CONTACT_ADDRESS to the email address of the recipient of
      "Contact Us" messages.
    - Set MAIL_CONTACT_NAME to the name of the recipient of "Contact Us"
      messages.

    Note:

    - Editing "/var/www/swamp-web-server/.env" requires root access.

Step 2: Modify "/var/www/html/scripts/config/config.js" to enable the
"Contact Us" page and set display parameters.

    - Add a "contact" array containing a "support" array (see example).
    - Add "email", "phoneNumber", "description", and "message", values
      to the "support" array (see sample).

    Note:

    - The config.js file defines parameters within Java Script arrays.
      Therefore it is important to maintain the Java Script array format
      when editing, adding, or removing parameters in this file.

    Sample:

    // contact information
    //         //
    contact: {

        support: {
            email: "Your support email address (optional - you may delete this line)",
            phoneNumber: "Your support phone number (optional - you may delete this line)",
            description: "our 24/7 support staff",
            message: "Feel free to contact us with questions."
        }
    },
    }


Enable "Report Security Incident" for SWAMP-in-a-Box
----------------------------------------------------

Prerequisite: You must have the "Contact Us" page in order to enable the
"Report Security Incident" page.

Step 1: Modify "/var/www/swamp-web-server/.env" to configure security
incident message recipients.

    - Set MAIL_SECURITY_ADDRESS to the email address of the recipient of
      "Report Security Incident" messages.
    - Set MAIL_SECURITY_NAME to the name of the recipient of "Report
      Security Incident" messages.

    Note:

    - Editing "/var/www/swamp-web-server/.env" requires root access.

Step 2: Modify "/var/www/html/scripts/config.js" to enable the "Report
Security Incident" page and set display parameters.

    - Add a "security" array to the "contact" array (see example).
    - Add "email", "phoneNumber", "description", and "message", values
      to the "security" array (see sample).

    Note:

    - The config.js file defines parameters within Java Script arrays.
      Therefore it is important to maintain the Java Script array format
      when editing, adding, or removing parameters in this file.

    Sample:

    // contact information
    //         //
    contact: {

        support: {
            email: "Your support email address (optional - you may delete this line)",
            phoneNumber: "Your support phone number (optional - you may delete this line)",
            description: "our 24/7 support staff",
            message: "Feel free to contact us with questions."
        },
        security: {
            email: "Your security email address (optional - you may delete this line)",
            phoneNumber: "Your security phone number (optional - you may delete this line)",
            description: "our security team",
            message: "Your security message here (optional - you may delete this line)"
        }
    },
    }
