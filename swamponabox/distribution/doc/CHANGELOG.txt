Noteworthy Changes in SWAMP-in-a-Box 1.28.1
===========================================

1. Added a new assessment tool: OWASP Dependency Check. This tool can be
used to assess Java 7 and 8 Source, and Java 7 and 8 Bytecode packages.

2. Added new versions of the cppcheck assessment tool. Updated the following
assessment tools: Bandit, Clang Static Analyzer, and cppcheck.

3. Updated platform versions and dependencies. All platforms from previous
releases have been deprecated. When upgrading to 1.28.1, existing
assessments will be modified to use the Ubuntu Linux version 16.04 platform.
The new platforms will work without an internet connection unless the
package being assessed requires the internet to build.

4. Added the "Status.out and Debugging SWAMP Failures" document to the Help
page to assist with debugging failed assessment runs.

5. Improved the reporting of assessment error messages in the Failed
Assessment Run Report (accessed by clicking the Error "!" button on an
assessment that finished with errors). Improved the reporting of failed
steps in the status.out file for failed assessment runs (found in the
results.tar.gz archive, downloadable from a Failed Assessment Report).

6. Added the ability to download assessment results in XML format. For
assessments that finished successfully and have at least one weakness, the
weakness count icon on the Assessment Results page is a link to download the
scarf.xml file.

7. Assessments display "default" as the platform if the default platform
will be used to run an assessment. Most supported package types have a
default platform of Ubuntu Linux version 16.04. Only C/C++ package types
allow selecting a platform when adding assessments.

8. The system no longer attempts to re-run a failed assessment, allowing
assessments to finish more quickly.
